# Portfolio site

The design for this site is based on the homepage for stripe.com. Being a highly regarded design, I thought building my portfolio as a mock up of Stripe's homepage would be a good opportunity to showcase an ability to code a given design from scratch. This was also an opportunity to demonstrate skill utilizing flexbox, grid, and custom SVG's.

The site is built using plain HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. Icons are from font-awesome, and fonts are from Google Fonts. Other than the color scheme, no code was copied from Stripe.
